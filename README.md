This repository contains the experimental code, results, and visualizations for the research project “Addressing Neural Network Training Challenges through Optimizers and Activation Functions.”
The study evaluates how various activation functions and optimizers influence training stability, convergence speed, gradient flow, and overall model performance using a SimpleCNN architecture on the MNIST dataset.
